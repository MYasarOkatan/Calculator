This project was developed using the NetBeans IDE. The primary goal of the project is to reinforce the practical use of the MySQL database management system and to provide hands-on experience. Therefore, data storage operations are performed through the MySQL database. For the project to function properly, a table needs to be created within a schema named ‘calculator’ in MySQL, consisting of three columns: an id column of type INT, a number column of type DOUBLE, and a sign column of type VARCHAR. This structure ensures the correct storage of data required during calculation operations and supports the functionality of the project.
